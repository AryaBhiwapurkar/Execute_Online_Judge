## üéØ What We Made & Why

`Execute_Online_Judge` replicates the core features of platforms like LeetCode or Codeforces ‚Äî but as a self-built, extensible, full-stack project.

**üîç Purpose:**

- Build a modular, real-world online judge system  
- Learn containerization, REST API design, and secure backend practices  
- Integrate AI for automated code feedback and ratings  
- Understand multi-language code execution in isolated environments

## üß™ Code Execution Flow

- Code is saved as a temp file on backend
- Backend spins up a Docker container with memory and time limits
- Compiles/executes the code using native compilers
- Captures output/errors and returns response

---

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Code Review

- After a successful submission, user's code is sent to the **Gemini API**
- AI returns:
  - Score (0‚Äì10) on readability and structure
  - Suggestions for improvement
  - Identified logic or performance issues
- Displayed in a friendly popup on the frontend

---

## üìà Results & Testing

- üîÑ Live-tested with 35+ users
- ‚úÖ Verified execution safety and feedback accuracy
- üß© Gathered feedback for future enhancements
