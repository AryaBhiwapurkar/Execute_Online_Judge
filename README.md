# ‚öôÔ∏è Execute_Online_Judge

An end-to-end **Online Judge Platform** for solving programming problems, executing multi-language code, and receiving instant test case feedback ‚Äî with **AI-powered code reviews** built-in.

> üß† Built using React, Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, and Google Gemini API.

---

## üéØ What We Made & Why

`Execute_Online_Judge` replicates the core features of platforms like LeetCode or Codeforces ‚Äî but as a self-built, extensible, full-stack project.

**üîç Purpose:**

- Build a modular, real-world online judge system  
- Learn containerization, REST API design, and secure backend practices  
- Integrate AI for automated code feedback and ratings  
- Understand multi-language code execution in isolated environments

## üß† How It Works

| Step     | Action                                                                 |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üîê Login  | JWT-based login; role (user/admin) assigned                           |
| üìÇ Select | Choose a coding problem from the dashboard                            |
| üíª Code   | Write code in the browser with selected language                      |
| ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run    | Sends code + input to backend; backend executes and returns output    |
| ‚úÖ Submit | Backend runs code against all hidden test cases; verdicts shown       |
| ü§ñ Review | Gemini AI rates code quality and offers improvement suggestions       |
| üõ†Ô∏è Admin  | Admin-only API endpoints for managing problems                        |

## üß™ Code Execution: Under the Hood

- When a user clicks **Run**, their code is:
  - Saved as a temporary file
  - Wrapped in a Docker container with the appropriate compiler/interpreter
  - Executed securely with timeout & memory constraints
  - Output or errors returned back to the frontend

- For **Submit**, the same process runs across all hidden test cases with verdicts like `Passed`, `Failed`, `Runtime Error`, etc.

---

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Code Review

- On submission, user code is sent to the **Gemini API**
- The AI returns:
  - A score (quality/readability)
  - Structural issues
  - Suggestions for cleaner logic or optimizations

You can add screenshots here showing:

- üìò Problem page
- üíª Code editor with language dropdown
- üìä Verdicts for each test case
- ü§ñ Gemini feedback panel
